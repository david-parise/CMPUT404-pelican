1. Question 1
-  Advantages: 
   a. Because static site generators create webpages in advance instead
      of on demand (as with a CMS), webpages load slightly faster in users' browsers.
   b. Developers can create any template they want and are not limited by the fields
      provided by a CMS or CMS's built-in templates.
   c. Static websites do not require as much code to run on the server side,
      whereas CMS-based websites constantly query the server side for content.
   Disadvantages:
   a. Many static site generators do not come with templates, meaning developers will
      have to spend a lot of time building them from scratch at first.
   b. It is harder for non-developer users to publish content using a static site generator.
      There is no CMS interface, and working with raw unformatted data may be intimidating
      for users.
